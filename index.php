        <h2>Origins of the Ladder</h2>
        <p>During the COVID lockdown of 2020, this ladder was brought in as a way for golfers to be able to continue to play in an organised competition, whilst still maintaining the rules of social distancing set down by the government.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Rules of the Ladder</h2>
        <ol id="rules">
            <li>Setup
              <ol id="indented">
                <li>	Initial positions on the ladder will be drawn randomly.</li>
                <li>	A player joining the competition after the start of the competition will begin at the bottom of the ladder.</li>
                <li>	The main competition will run until the end of December 2020, with the last date for making challenges being 30th November 2020</li>
                <li>	During the final month of challenges (ie. after 31st October 2020), no challenges will be allowed that involve only players in the top three positions on the ladder. This is to ensure a fair opportunity for players in lower positions to challenge for a place in the deciding ‘knock out’ games.</li>
                <li>	After the main competition is completed, the top four places will play ‘knock out’ games to decide the overall competition winner (1st vs 4th & 2nd vs 3rd, with the winners of those games to play in a final).</li>
                <li>	All games will be 18 hole match play, using full official handicaps on the day of the game. The player with the higher handicap will receive a number of strokes equal to the difference between the two player’s handicaps.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li id="indented">Making Challenges
              <ol>
                <li>A challenge can be made against another player up to 3 places higher on the ladder.</li>
                <li>A player can only be involved in one challenge at a time.</li>
                <li>Unless a player is already involved in an uncompleted challenge, all challenges must be accepted.</li>
                <li>The game to complete a challenge is to be played within three weeks of the date the challenge is made. The player being challenged will offer at least two reasonable dates/times for the game within the three week period, or forfeit the challenge.</li>
                <li>If both players agree that it is not possible to play a game on the agreed date due to course conditions, the players involved can agree an alternative date up to one week later.</li>
                <li>If the challenger wins the game, then the positions of those players on the ladder will be exchanged. If the challenger loses the game (or in the event of a tie), then there will be no change to positions on the ladder.</li>
                <li>Players involved in a challenge cannot re-challenge the same opponent until they have played in at least one challenge against another player.</li>
              </ol>
            </li>
         </ol>
